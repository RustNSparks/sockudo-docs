## What is Sockudo?

Sockudo is a robust, memory-efficient WebSockets server written in Rust. It's fully compatible with the Pusher protocol, providing a seamless integration path for applications currently using Pusher or those looking for a high-performance alternative, especially within the Laravel ecosystem with Laravel Echo.

Our goal is to provide a modern, scalable, and easy-to-use WebSocket solution that developers can rely on for their real-time communication needs.

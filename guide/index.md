Welcome to the Sockudo guide! This section will walk you through everything you need to know to get Sockudo up and running, configure it for your needs, and understand its core features.

Sockudo is a high-performance WebSocket server built in Rust that is compatible with the Pusher protocol. This means you can use existing Pusher client libraries to connect to Sockudo and build real-time applications.
